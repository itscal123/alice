## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a corpus-based chatbot that can hold a general conversation, but with a sense of humor and wit. We will use a hybrid architecture that generates responses using both retrieval (bi-encoder model) and generation methods (encoder-decoder model) trained on datasets such as the Sarcasm Corpus v2 and Film Corpus 1.0 (for humor and wit) and on Cornell Movie-Dialogue Corpus (for general chatbot behavior), respectively. Evaluation will be measured using user studies.
