L2886+++$+++You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L4198+++$+++Two more.+++$+++L4199+++$+++Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
L4197+++$+++Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?+++$+++L4198+++$+++Two more.
L4196+++$+++I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.+++$+++L4197+++$+++Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
L4193+++$+++No.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4192+++$+++You're kidding.+++$+++L4193+++$+++No.
L4191+++$+++Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.+++$+++L4192+++$+++You're kidding.
L4190+++$+++Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?+++$+++L4191+++$+++Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
L4189+++$+++Are you reasonably awake?+++$+++L4190+++$+++Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
L4188+++$+++Good morning. How's it going?+++$+++L4189+++$+++Are you reasonably awake?
L4163+++$+++Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4162+++$+++Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.+++$+++L4163+++$+++Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
L4161+++$+++I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.+++$+++L4162+++$+++Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
L4160+++$+++Yes, I don't know what to make of it.+++$+++L4161+++$+++I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
L4159+++$+++Well, that's something.+++$+++L4160+++$+++Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
L4017+++$+++Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4016+++$+++I guess it isn't.+++$+++L4017+++$+++Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
L4015+++$+++I suppose it isn't logically impossible.+++$+++L4016+++$+++I guess it isn't.
L4014+++$+++But not completely inconceivable?+++$+++L4015+++$+++I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
L4013+++$+++I know. It would be almost inconceivable.+++$+++L4014+++$+++But not completely inconceivable?
L4012+++$+++Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.+++$+++L4013+++$+++I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
L4011+++$+++Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.+++$+++L4012+++$+++Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
L4001+++$+++That's true.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4000+++$+++Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.+++$+++L4001+++$+++That's true.
L3999+++$+++How?+++$+++L4000+++$+++Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
L3998+++$+++Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.+++$+++L3999+++$+++How?
L3997+++$+++Yes, I thought so.+++$+++L3998+++$+++Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
L3996+++$+++That seems very unlikely.+++$+++L3997+++$+++Yes, I thought so.
L3995+++$+++I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.+++$+++L3996+++$+++That seems very unlikely.
L3992+++$+++Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3991+++$+++No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.+++$+++L3992+++$+++Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
L3990+++$+++Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.+++$+++L3991+++$+++No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
L3989+++$+++Oh?+++$+++L3990+++$+++Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
L3988+++$+++I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.+++$+++L3989+++$+++Oh?
L3987+++$+++I suppose the idea was specialized training.+++$+++L3988+++$+++I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
L3984+++$+++No. I never did, either.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3983+++$+++I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.+++$+++L3984+++$+++No. I never did, either.
L3982+++$+++I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.+++$+++L3983+++$+++I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
L3981+++$+++Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?+++$+++L3982+++$+++I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
L3980+++$+++It's possible.+++$+++L3981+++$+++Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
L3979+++$+++Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.+++$+++L3980+++$+++It's possible.
L3976+++$+++Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3975+++$+++Yes.+++$+++L3976+++$+++Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
L3974+++$+++Really.+++$+++L3975+++$+++Yes.
L3973+++$+++Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.+++$+++L3974+++$+++Really.
L3972+++$+++That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.+++$+++L3973+++$+++Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
L3969+++$+++Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3968+++$+++Yes?+++$+++L3969+++$+++Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
L3967+++$+++It's about my salary cheques.+++$+++L3968+++$+++Yes?
L3966+++$+++What's up?+++$+++L3967+++$+++It's about my salary cheques.
L3965+++$+++Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.+++$+++L3966+++$+++What's up?
L3964+++$+++Sure, what is it?+++$+++L3965+++$+++Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
L3963+++$+++Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.+++$+++L3964+++$+++Sure, what is it?
L3945+++$+++Okay, come on down.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3944+++$+++Okay.+++$+++L3945+++$+++Okay, come on down.
L3943+++$+++Right. Just a sec.+++$+++L3944+++$+++Okay.
L3942+++$+++Hi. Frank... coming in, please.+++$+++L3943+++$+++Right. Just a sec.
L4368+++$+++Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4367+++$+++I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.+++$+++L4368+++$+++Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
L4366+++$+++I am prepared to do that anyway.+++$+++L4367+++$+++I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
L4363+++$+++Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4362+++$+++I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.+++$+++L4363+++$+++Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
L4361+++$+++Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.+++$+++L4362+++$+++I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
L4360+++$+++I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.+++$+++L4361+++$+++Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
L4357+++$+++I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4356+++$+++Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.+++$+++L4357+++$+++I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
L4355+++$+++Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.+++$+++L4356+++$+++Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
L4354+++$+++I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.+++$+++L4355+++$+++Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
L4353+++$+++If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.+++$+++L4354+++$+++I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
L4350+++$+++I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4349+++$+++It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.+++$+++L4350+++$+++I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
L4348+++$+++Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.+++$+++L4349+++$+++It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
L4347+++$+++The antenna has to be replaced.+++$+++L4348+++$+++Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
L4346+++$+++I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.+++$+++L4347+++$+++The antenna has to be replaced.
L4335+++$+++I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4334+++$+++Yes, it is.+++$+++L4335+++$+++I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
L4333+++$+++Too bad about Frank, isn't it?+++$+++L4334+++$+++Yes, it is.
L4271+++$+++Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4270+++$+++Yes, it is, Hal.+++$+++L4271+++$+++Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
L4269+++$+++Is your confidence in me fully restored?+++$+++L4270+++$+++Yes, it is, Hal.
L4268+++$+++And don't you worry about it.+++$+++L4269+++$+++Is your confidence in me fully restored?
L4267+++$+++Well, don't worry about it.+++$+++L4268+++$+++And don't you worry about it.
L4266+++$+++I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.+++$+++L4267+++$+++Well, don't worry about it.
L4265+++$+++Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.+++$+++L4266+++$+++I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
L4230+++$+++Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4229+++$+++Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.+++$+++L4230+++$+++Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
L4228+++$+++Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?+++$+++L4229+++$+++Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
L4227+++$+++I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.+++$+++L4228+++$+++Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
L4224+++$+++Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4223+++$+++You probably also know that we found them okay.+++$+++L4224+++$+++Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
L4222+++$+++Yes, I know.+++$+++L4223+++$+++You probably also know that we found them okay.
L4221+++$+++You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?+++$+++L4222+++$+++Yes, I know.
L4220+++$+++Sure, Dave, what's up?+++$+++L4221+++$+++You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
L4219+++$+++Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.+++$+++L4220+++$+++Sure, Dave, what's up?
L4080+++$+++I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4079+++$+++The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.+++$+++L4080+++$+++I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
L4070+++$+++MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4069+++$+++What is it, Hal?+++$+++L4070+++$+++MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
L4068+++$+++Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.+++$+++L4069+++$+++What is it, Hal?
L4007+++$+++He's got a point.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4006+++$+++I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.+++$+++L4007+++$+++He's got a point.
L4019+++$+++Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L3768+++$+++Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3767+++$+++Certainly.+++$+++L3768+++$+++Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
L3766+++$+++Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?+++$+++L3767+++$+++Certainly.
L3763+++$+++Well, I'm glad about that.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3762+++$+++Fortunately, they did.+++$+++L3763+++$+++Well, I'm glad about that.
L3761+++$+++Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.+++$+++L3762+++$+++Fortunately, they did.
L3760+++$+++Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.+++$+++L3761+++$+++Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
L3754+++$+++I see.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3753+++$+++That's right.+++$+++L3754+++$+++I see.
L3752+++$+++You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?+++$+++L3753+++$+++That's right.
L3751+++$+++Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.+++$+++L3752+++$+++You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
L3748+++$+++Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3747+++$+++Really?+++$+++L3748+++$+++Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
L3746+++$+++Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.+++$+++L3747+++$+++Really?
L3745+++$+++I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.+++$+++L3746+++$+++Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
L3740+++$+++Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3739+++$+++Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?+++$+++L3740+++$+++Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
L3738+++$+++Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon+++$+++L3739+++$+++Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
L3726+++$+++Yes, really, thank you very much.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3725+++$+++Are you quite sure?+++$+++L3726+++$+++Yes, really, thank you very much.
L3724+++$+++Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.+++$+++L3725+++$+++Are you quite sure?
L3907+++$+++I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3906+++$+++Has it been exposed to any sun before now?+++$+++L3907+++$+++I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
L3905+++$+++Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?+++$+++L3906+++$+++Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
L3904+++$+++Any ideas about the colour?+++$+++L3905+++$+++Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
L3897+++$+++Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3896+++$+++But you don't have any idea as to what it is?+++$+++L3897+++$+++Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
L3893+++$+++Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3892+++$+++Any clue as to what it is?+++$+++L3893+++$+++Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
L3891+++$+++By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.+++$+++L3892+++$+++Any clue as to what it is?
L3890+++$+++How can you tell it was deliberately buried?+++$+++L3891+++$+++By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
L3889+++$+++Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.+++$+++L3890+++$+++How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
L3869+++$+++I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3868+++$+++Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?+++$+++L3869+++$+++I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
L3839+++$+++Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3838+++$+++No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.+++$+++L3839+++$+++Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
L3837+++$+++Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?+++$+++L3838+++$+++No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
L3834+++$+++Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3833+++$+++I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.+++$+++L3834+++$+++Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
L3832+++$+++Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.+++$+++L3833+++$+++I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
L3829+++$+++I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3828+++$+++I see.+++$+++L3829+++$+++I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
L3827+++$+++Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.+++$+++L3828+++$+++I see.
L3826+++$+++What do you mean?+++$+++L3827+++$+++Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
L3825+++$+++Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?+++$+++L3826+++$+++What do you mean?
L3824+++$+++Thank you.+++$+++L3825+++$+++Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
L3821+++$+++Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L3820+++$+++We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?+++$+++L3821+++$+++Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
L3819+++$+++When do we arrive at Clavius?+++$+++L3820+++$+++We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
L3818+++$+++There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.+++$+++L3819+++$+++When do we arrive at Clavius?
L3817+++$+++Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.+++$+++L3818+++$+++There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
L4183+++$+++All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4182+++$+++Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.+++$+++L4183+++$+++All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
L4181+++$+++Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?+++$+++L4182+++$+++Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
L4175+++$+++Let me see the tracking alignment display.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4174+++$+++I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.+++$+++L4175+++$+++Let me see the tracking alignment display.
L4170+++$+++It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L4169+++$+++Yes, Hal, what's up?+++$+++L4170+++$+++It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.

L4032+++$+++That's true.+++$+++L4033+++$+++Thank you very much, Hal.
L4031+++$+++There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?+++$+++L4032+++$+++That's true.
L4030+++$+++That's true+++$+++L4031+++$+++There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?

L5227+++$+++Luther's on the move...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5226+++$+++Why?+++$+++L5227+++$+++Luther's on the move...
L5225+++$+++When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.+++$+++L5226+++$+++Why?
L5224+++$+++That was quick.+++$+++L5225+++$+++When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
L5213+++$+++I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5212+++$+++Yeah, I see her.+++$+++L5213+++$+++I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.

L5207+++$+++You sure that's the reason?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5206+++$+++I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...+++$+++L5207+++$+++You sure that's the reason?
L5205+++$+++Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5204+++$+++Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?+++$+++L5205+++$+++Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
L5202+++$+++So you took the rest of the night off...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5201+++$+++They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.+++$+++L5202+++$+++So you took the rest of the night off...
L5200+++$+++Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5199+++$+++Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.+++$+++L5200+++$+++Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.

L5076+++$+++That was in style a couple years back, man.+++$+++L5077+++$+++Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
L5074+++$+++Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5073+++$+++We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?+++$+++L5074+++$+++Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
L5072+++$+++Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5071+++$+++No class...+++$+++L5072+++$+++Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
L5070+++$+++What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.+++$+++L5071+++$+++No class...
L5069+++$+++You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.+++$+++L5070+++$+++What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
L5068+++$+++Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5067+++$+++A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...+++$+++L5068+++$+++Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
L5066+++$+++If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5065+++$+++Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...+++$+++L5066+++$+++If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
L5064+++$+++You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L5060+++$+++Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?+++$+++L5061+++$+++If they don't tell me what I need to know...
L5059+++$+++That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L5058+++$+++I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.+++$+++L5059+++$+++That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
L5057+++$+++I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...+++$+++L5058+++$+++I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.

L5033+++$+++You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.+++$+++L5034+++$+++Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.

L5294+++$+++It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.

L6453+++$+++They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.+++$+++L6454+++$+++Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
L6452+++$+++I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L6450+++$+++I'm not so sure about this.+++$+++L6451+++$+++They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
L6449+++$+++This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either.

Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.+++$+++L6450+++$+++I'm not so sure about this.
L6448+++$+++Why don't they come to me?+++$+++L6449+++$+++This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.

L6447+++$+++For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.+++$+++L6448+++$+++Why don't they come to me?
L6446+++$+++We do.+++$+++L6447+++$+++For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
L6445+++$+++I figured you share information.+++$+++L6446+++$+++We do.
L6444+++$+++Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?+++$+++L6445+++$+++I figured you share information.
L6443+++$+++Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.+++$+++L6444+++$+++Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
L6442+++$+++Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6441+++$+++There are reasons for the way we do things here.+++$+++L6442+++$+++Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
L6440+++$+++What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...+++$+++L6441+++$+++There are reasons for the way we do things here.

L6438+++$+++Call me Tom.+++$+++L6439+++$+++Alright, Tom.
L6437+++$+++What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?+++$+++L6438+++$+++Call me Tom.
L7076+++$+++What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L7075+++$+++That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.+++$+++L7076+++$+++What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
L7074+++$+++I never killed anyone.+++$+++L7075+++$+++That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
L7073+++$+++Easy enough for you.+++$+++L7074+++$+++I never killed anyone.
L7072+++$+++Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?+++$+++L7073+++$+++Easy enough for you.
L7071+++$+++Don't think I won't.+++$+++L7072+++$+++Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
L7070+++$+++Do it.+++$+++L7071+++$+++Don't think I won't.
L7067+++$+++I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L7054+++$+++There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.

I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.

L6886+++$+++You're making me very angry.+++$+++L6887+++$+++Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
L6885+++$+++Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L6882+++$+++Shut up.+++$+++L6883+++$+++Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
L6881+++$+++You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...+++$+++L6882+++$+++Shut up.
L6880+++$+++Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6879+++$+++None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.+++$+++L6880+++$+++Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
L6878+++$+++Except, you're willing commit murder with them.+++$+++L6879+++$+++None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
L6877+++$+++They're no friends of mine.+++$+++L6878+++$+++Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
L6876+++$+++Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...+++$+++L6877+++$+++They're no friends of mine.
L6875+++$+++Never mind how I found you.+++$+++L6876+++$+++Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
L6874+++$+++That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?+++$+++L6875+++$+++Never mind how I found you.
L6873+++$+++I was well compensated.+++$+++L6874+++$+++That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
L6872+++$+++Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.+++$+++L6873+++$+++I was well compensated.
L6871+++$+++That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.+++$+++L6872+++$+++Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
L6870+++$+++So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.+++$+++L6871+++$+++That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
L6869+++$+++Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.+++$+++L6870+++$+++So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
L6868+++$+++You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.+++$+++L6869+++$+++Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
L6380+++$+++Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L6378+++$+++You are a private investigator?+++$+++L6379+++$+++That's right.
L6377+++$+++Of what sort?+++$+++L6378+++$+++You are a private investigator?
L6376+++$+++As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.+++$+++L6377+++$+++Of what sort?

L6374+++$+++Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.+++$+++L6375+++$+++I'm listening.
L6824+++$+++It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L6632+++$+++You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?+++$+++L6633+++$+++What about me?

Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?

This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.

L6614+++$+++You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.+++$+++L6615+++$+++Interesting theory.

L6748+++$+++How will I get it to you?+++$+++L6749+++$+++If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
L6747+++$+++I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.+++$+++L6748+++$+++How will I get it to you?
L6746+++$+++Fine...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6745+++$+++I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.+++$+++L6746+++$+++Fine...
L6744+++$+++Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?+++$+++L6745+++$+++I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
L6743+++$+++I hope it's nothing serious.+++$+++L6744+++$+++Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
L6742+++$+++I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.+++$+++L6743+++$+++I hope it's nothing serious.
L6741+++$+++I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?+++$+++L6742+++$+++I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
L6740+++$+++How are you?  Having any luck?+++$+++L6741+++$+++I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
L6739+++$+++Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.+++$+++L6740+++$+++How are you?  Having any luck?
L6738+++$+++Hello?+++$+++L6739+++$+++Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
L6655+++$+++You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6654+++$+++You told me to look, so I looked.+++$+++L6655+++$+++You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
L6653+++$+++Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?+++$+++L6654+++$+++You told me to look, so I looked.
L6652+++$+++Okay.+++$+++L6653+++$+++Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
L6651+++$+++For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.+++$+++L6652+++$+++Okay.
L6650+++$+++Do you think the film could have cost that much?+++$+++L6651+++$+++For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
L6649+++$+++I'm here.+++$+++L6650+++$+++Do you think the film could have cost that much?
L6648+++$+++Hello... ?+++$+++L6649+++$+++I'm here.
L6647+++$+++To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6646+++$+++You're joking.+++$+++L6647+++$+++To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
L6645+++$+++Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.+++$+++L6646+++$+++You're joking.
L6644+++$+++Okay, I follow you so far...+++$+++L6645+++$+++Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
L6643+++$+++One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...+++$+++L6644+++$+++Okay, I follow you so far...
L6642+++$+++The checks were for odd amounts...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6641+++$+++I'm not positive this means anything.+++$+++L6642+++$+++The checks were for odd amounts...
L6640+++$+++My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.+++$+++L6641+++$+++I'm not positive this means anything.
L6639+++$+++Okay...+++$+++L6640+++$+++My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
L6428+++$+++I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6427+++$+++Nothing remotely like this.+++$+++L6428+++$+++I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
L6426+++$+++You've found missing persons before.+++$+++L6427+++$+++Nothing remotely like this.
L6425+++$+++I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...+++$+++L6426+++$+++You've found missing persons before.
L6424+++$+++Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6423+++$+++It won't work like that.+++$+++L6424+++$+++Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.

L6422+++$+++No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...+++$+++L6423+++$+++It won't work like that.
L6421+++$+++You don't have any other choice.+++$+++L6422+++$+++No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
L6420+++$+++I told you I can't, not yet.+++$+++L6421+++$+++You don't have any other choice.
L6419+++$+++You... you need to go to the police.+++$+++L6420+++$+++I told you I can't, not yet.
L6418+++$+++Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6417+++$+++Will you watch it and see for yourself?+++$+++L6418+++$+++Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
L6416+++$+++I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.+++$+++L6417+++$+++Will you watch it and see for yourself?
L6415+++$+++I'm telling you it's not that.+++$+++L6416+++$+++I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
L6414+++$+++If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...+++$+++L6415+++$+++I'm telling you it's not that.
L6413+++$+++No.+++$+++L6414+++$+++If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
L6412+++$+++Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...+++$+++L6413+++$+++No.
L6411+++$+++Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6410+++$+++I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...+++$+++L6411+++$+++Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."

L6409+++$+++This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L6405+++$+++Do you want to tell me what you found?+++$+++L6406+++$+++Cash, stock certificates, and this...
L6404+++$+++There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...+++$+++L6405+++$+++Do you want to tell me what you found?

L6402+++$+++My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.+++$+++L6403+++$+++You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
L6401+++$+++Just curious.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6400+++$+++I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.+++$+++L6401+++$+++Just curious.

L6398+++$+++We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L6536+++$+++What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth?

I'd choose to know.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L6534+++$+++I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.+++$+++L6535+++$+++It's been six years.
L6532+++$+++Yes.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6531+++$+++You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?+++$+++L6532+++$+++Yes.
L6528+++$+++You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L6522+++$+++It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...+++$+++L6523+++$+++No.  You don't have any reason to think that...

L6518+++$+++It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.

L6515+++$+++You should be.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6514+++$+++No.+++$+++L6515+++$+++You should be.
L6513+++$+++Are you religious?+++$+++L6514+++$+++No.
L6512+++$+++We're all like that.+++$+++L6513+++$+++Are you religious?
L6511+++$+++Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.+++$+++L6512+++$+++We're all like that.

L6503+++$+++People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?+++$+++L6504+++$+++Of course.
L6502+++$+++No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L6501+++$+++I had to ask.  I apologize.+++$+++L6502+++$+++No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.

L6495+++$+++Why do you think he did it?+++$+++L6496+++$+++It got to be too much for him.
L6494+++$+++We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...+++$+++L6495+++$+++Why do you think he did it?
L6493+++$+++September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.+++$+++L6494+++$+++We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
L6492+++$+++Yes.+++$+++L6493+++$+++September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
L6491+++$+++If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?+++$+++L6492+++$+++Yes.
L6490+++$+++I don't know.+++$+++L6491+++$+++If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
L6489+++$+++What was she running from?+++$+++L6490+++$+++I don't know.
L6488+++$+++She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.+++$+++L6489+++$+++What was she running from?

L6486+++$+++No.+++$+++L6487+++$+++She just seemed... depressed... ?

L6483+++$+++You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like?

L8079+++$+++Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.+++$+++L8080+++$+++I know.  Uh...Alice.

L8184+++$+++Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.+++$+++L8185+++$+++It was Freddy.
L8092+++$+++Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8091+++$+++I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.+++$+++L8092+++$+++Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.

L8227+++$+++She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.+++$+++L8228+++$+++About Freddy?

L8451+++$+++It's just across the park.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8450+++$+++You sure you don't want a ride to work?+++$+++L8451+++$+++It's just across the park.
L8449+++$+++Thanks for everything, Dad.+++$+++L8450+++$+++You sure you don't want a ride to work?
L8447+++$+++To take a picture.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8446+++$+++Where are we going?+++$+++L8447+++$+++To take a picture.
L8444+++$+++It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8443+++$+++Dad!+++$+++L8444+++$+++It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
L8442+++$+++No.  A deal's a deal.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8441+++$+++That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.+++$+++L8442+++$+++No.  A deal's a deal.
L8440+++$+++I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...+++$+++L8441+++$+++That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
L8439+++$+++I was afraid you weren't coming.+++$+++L8440+++$+++I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
L8819+++$+++That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8818+++$+++He sure loves to stay awake.+++$+++L8819+++$+++That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
L8817+++$+++So did Dan.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8816+++$+++You do good work, Alice.+++$+++L8817+++$+++So did Dan.
L8778+++$+++We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8777+++$+++But how are we gonna --+++$+++L8778+++$+++We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
L8776+++$+++Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8775+++$+++What?+++$+++L8776+++$+++Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
L8770+++$+++If they actually bothered to bury her.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8769+++$+++You think that's the place she's buried?+++$+++L8770+++$+++If they actually bothered to bury her.
L8760+++$+++Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8759+++$+++Are you alright?+++$+++L8760+++$+++Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
L8705+++$+++That's the only reason you're alive...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8704+++$+++Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...+++$+++L8705+++$+++That's the only reason you're alive...
L8700+++$+++Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8699+++$+++All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?+++$+++L8700+++$+++Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
L8698+++$+++What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8697+++$+++And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!+++$+++L8698+++$+++What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
L8696+++$+++Krueger is reality.+++$+++L8697+++$+++And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
L8695+++$+++I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.+++$+++L8696+++$+++Krueger is reality.
L8677+++$+++I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8676+++$+++I really think you need to calm down now, okay?+++$+++L8677+++$+++I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
L8675+++$+++Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8674+++$+++Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...+++$+++L8675+++$+++Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
L8673+++$+++I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8672+++$+++You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?+++$+++L8673+++$+++I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
L8621+++$+++Why don't you two stick to reality.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8620+++$+++I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?+++$+++L8621+++$+++Why don't you two stick to reality.
L8614+++$+++No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8613+++$+++It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.+++$+++L8614+++$+++No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
L8565+++$+++When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8564+++$+++What's that got to do with it?+++$+++L8565+++$+++When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
L8552+++$+++They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8551+++$+++Did everyone call everyone?+++$+++L8552+++$+++They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
L8547+++$+++He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8546+++$+++There aren't any little boys on your floor.+++$+++L8547+++$+++He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
L8545+++$+++Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?+++$+++L8546+++$+++There aren't any little boys on your floor.
L8523+++$+++Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8522+++$+++It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.+++$+++L8523+++$+++Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
L8394+++$+++Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8393+++$+++Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.+++$+++L8394+++$+++Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
L8365+++$+++No, the Dan part was nice...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8364+++$+++Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.+++$+++L8365+++$+++No, the Dan part was nice...
L8363+++$+++Had kind of a long night.+++$+++L8364+++$+++Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
L8362+++$+++Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.+++$+++L8363+++$+++Had kind of a long night.
L8743+++$+++She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8742+++$+++I don't understand.+++$+++L8743+++$+++She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
L8741+++$+++No shit.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8740+++$+++Poor woman...+++$+++L8741+++$+++No shit.
L8739+++$+++Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8738+++$+++But I've seen her grave.+++$+++L8739+++$+++Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
L8737+++$+++They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.+++$+++L8738+++$+++But I've seen her grave.
L8736+++$+++Meaning?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8735+++$+++That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.+++$+++L8736+++$+++Meaning?
L8734+++$+++No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?+++$+++L8735+++$+++That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
L8733+++$+++That's their problem.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8732+++$+++They think I'm nuts.+++$+++L8733+++$+++That's their problem.
L8711+++$+++Then we'll find another way.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8710+++$+++I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.+++$+++L8711+++$+++Then we'll find another way.
L8671+++$+++I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L8638+++$+++It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8637+++$+++Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.+++$+++L8638+++$+++It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.

L8617+++$+++She must've fallen asleep at the table...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8616+++$+++I thought about that.+++$+++L8617+++$+++She must've fallen asleep at the table...

L8571+++$+++All of us.  Right?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8570+++$+++Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.+++$+++L8571+++$+++All of us.  Right?
L8563+++$+++Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8562+++$+++Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.+++$+++L8563+++$+++Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.

L8558+++$+++Stop saying that, it's bullshit.+++$+++L8559+++$+++I want to talk about the baby.
L8484+++$+++Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L8427+++$+++That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8426+++$+++Yeah...+++$+++L8427+++$+++That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
L8425+++$+++All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...+++$+++L8426+++$+++Yeah...

L8629+++$+++It's okay.+++$+++L8630+++$+++Stick around, please?
L8625+++$+++I can't listen to this.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8624+++$+++I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!+++$+++L8625+++$+++I can't listen to this.
L8623+++$+++Mark...+++$+++L8624+++$+++I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
L8622+++$+++Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!+++$+++L8623+++$+++Mark...
L8499+++$+++Faint.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8498+++$+++Vomit?+++$+++L8499+++$+++Faint.
L8481+++$+++Two hours a day, six days a week.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L8480+++$+++Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.+++$+++L8481+++$+++Two hours a day, six days a week.
L55857+++$+++And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55856+++$+++I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -+++$+++L55857+++$+++And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
L55855+++$+++I don't know.+++$+++L55856+++$+++I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
L55854+++$+++But if they <u>do</u>?+++$+++L55855+++$+++I don't know.
L55853+++$+++Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.+++$+++L55854+++$+++But if they <u>do</u>?
L55852+++$+++Which is the one - we have to worry about?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55851+++$+++Yes?+++$+++L55852+++$+++Which is the one - we have to worry about?
L55850+++$+++They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -+++$+++L55851+++$+++Yes?
L55668+++$+++I'd sooner swim!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55667+++$+++However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -+++$+++L55668+++$+++I'd sooner swim!
L55666+++$+++- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55665+++$+++That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !+++$+++L55666+++$+++- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
L55538+++$+++Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55537+++$+++Unidentified Flying Objects.+++$+++L55538+++$+++Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
L55458+++$+++You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55457+++$+++Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!

L55455+++$+++Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!+++$+++L55456+++$+++You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
L55454+++$+++You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?+++$+++L55455+++$+++Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
L55453+++$+++That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!+++$+++L55454+++$+++You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
L55452+++$+++We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!+++$+++L55453+++$+++That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
L55451+++$+++Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...+++$+++L55452+++$+++We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
L55450+++$+++<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55449+++$+++You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!+++$+++L55450+++$+++<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
L55448+++$+++Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55447+++$+++What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'+++$+++L55448+++$+++Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
L55446+++$+++Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55445+++$+++My father!  He's not - ?+++$+++L55446+++$+++Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
L55444+++$+++Your 'out.'  This came for you.+++$+++L55445+++$+++My father!  He's not - ?
L55443+++$+++What is it?+++$+++L55444+++$+++Your 'out.'  This came for you.
L55390+++$+++Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55389+++$+++You could train someone else.+++$+++L55390+++$+++Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
L55387+++$+++And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L55386+++$+++It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.+++$+++L55387+++$+++And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
L55385+++$+++How is he - ?+++$+++L55386+++$+++It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
L55384+++$+++It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.+++$+++L55385+++$+++How is he - ?
L55383+++$+++I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.+++$+++L55384+++$+++It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.

L55712+++$+++Why do you say that?+++$+++L55713+++$+++We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!

L12110+++$+++Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble.

L12104+++$+++I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.+++$+++L12105+++$+++Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
L12767+++$+++Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L12765+++$+++You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?+++$+++L12766+++$+++The key, Wade.
L12764+++$+++Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.+++$+++L12765+++$+++You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
L12703+++$+++Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12702+++$+++Could be.+++$+++L12703+++$+++Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
L12701+++$+++You and Mel Gordon?+++$+++L12702+++$+++Could be.
L12700+++$+++Maybe.+++$+++L12701+++$+++You and Mel Gordon?
L12699+++$+++I won't. You interested?+++$+++L12700+++$+++Maybe.
L12698+++$+++Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.+++$+++L12699+++$+++I won't. You interested?
L12697+++$+++Want to buy?+++$+++L12698+++$+++Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
L12696+++$+++What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?+++$+++L12697+++$+++Want to buy?
L12695+++$+++That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.+++$+++L12696+++$+++What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
L12694+++$+++Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.+++$+++L12695+++$+++That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
L12693+++$+++You? Why?+++$+++L12694+++$+++Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
L12692+++$+++Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.+++$+++L12693+++$+++You? Why?
L12691+++$+++He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.+++$+++L12692+++$+++Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
L12690+++$+++So?+++$+++L12691+++$+++He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
L12689+++$+++I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.+++$+++L12690+++$+++So?
L12688+++$+++Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.+++$+++L12689+++$+++I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
L12687+++$+++What do I have to do for it?+++$+++L12688+++$+++Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
L12684+++$+++Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12683+++$+++On what you pay me?+++$+++L12684+++$+++Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
L12682+++$+++You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?+++$+++L12683+++$+++On what you pay me?
L12681+++$+++Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.+++$+++L12682+++$+++You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?

L12574+++$+++How you holding up, Wade?+++$+++L12575+++$+++I'm fine, fine.
L12397+++$+++Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12396+++$+++Yeah. A few things.+++$+++L12397+++$+++Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
L12395+++$+++Something bugging you?+++$+++L12396+++$+++Yeah. A few things.
L12394+++$+++It ain't done, if that's what you mean.+++$+++L12395+++$+++Something bugging you?
L12393+++$+++What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.+++$+++L12394+++$+++It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
L12378+++$+++Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12377+++$+++You want me to follow them to Littleton?+++$+++L12378+++$+++Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
L12376+++$+++That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.+++$+++L12377+++$+++You want me to follow them to Littleton?
L12375+++$+++Like hell.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L12373+++$+++I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.+++$+++L12374+++$+++You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
L12372+++$+++I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.+++$+++L12373+++$+++I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
L12371+++$+++He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.+++$+++L12372+++$+++I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
L12370+++$+++Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L12524+++$+++Did you tell them?  That we were coming?+++$+++L12525+++$+++Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
L12516+++$+++Good.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12515+++$+++Alright. I'll think about it.+++$+++L12516+++$+++Good.
L12514+++$+++It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?+++$+++L12515+++$+++Alright. I'll think about it.

L12503+++$+++Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.+++$+++L12504+++$+++What way?

L12499+++$+++But not now.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12498+++$+++No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.+++$+++L12499+++$+++But not now.
L12497+++$+++You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.+++$+++L12498+++$+++No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
L12496+++$+++No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.+++$+++L12497+++$+++You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.

L12490+++$+++Money.+++$+++L12491+++$+++Jack doesn't need money.
L12489+++$+++Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12488+++$+++I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.+++$+++L12489+++$+++Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
L12487+++$+++...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.+++$+++L12488+++$+++I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.

L12484+++$+++There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.+++$+++L12485+++$+++I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
L12483+++$+++Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.+++$+++L12484+++$+++There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.

L12559+++$+++In the living room.+++$+++L12560+++$+++Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
L12558+++$+++Is there something wrong with the phone?+++$+++L12559+++$+++In the living room.
L12557+++$+++I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.+++$+++L12558+++$+++Is there something wrong with the phone?
L12556+++$+++Yeah.+++$+++L12557+++$+++I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
L12545+++$+++She's coming.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12544+++$+++Where's Ma?+++$+++L12545+++$+++She's coming.

L12541+++$+++We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?+++$+++L12542+++$+++Yeah.
L12540+++$+++How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.+++$+++L12541+++$+++We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
L12539+++$+++From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?+++$+++L12540+++$+++How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
L12538+++$+++You remember Margie Fogg?+++$+++L12539+++$+++From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
L12537+++$+++Sleeping.+++$+++L12538+++$+++You remember Margie Fogg?
L12536+++$+++Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?+++$+++L12537+++$+++Sleeping.

L12311+++$+++Just do it.+++$+++L12312+++$+++Atta-go.

L12771+++$+++Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things.

Let them work on this.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12770+++$+++To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them.

L12769+++$+++For what?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12768+++$+++I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.+++$+++L12769+++$+++For what?
L12727+++$+++But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12726+++$+++Wade, are you alright?+++$+++L12727+++$+++But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
L12725+++$+++Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.+++$+++L12726+++$+++Wade, are you alright?
L12649+++$+++That's what you think.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12648+++$+++I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.+++$+++L12649+++$+++That's what you think.
L12647+++$+++Well, I never heard that one.+++$+++L12648+++$+++I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
L12646+++$+++And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.+++$+++L12647+++$+++Well, I never heard that one.
L12645+++$+++We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.+++$+++L12646+++$+++And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
L12644+++$+++It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.+++$+++L12645+++$+++We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
L12643+++$+++You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?+++$+++L12644+++$+++It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
L12642+++$+++It may have happened, but not the way you said.+++$+++L12643+++$+++You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
L12641+++$+++Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?+++$+++L12642+++$+++It may have happened, but not the way you said.
L12640+++$+++I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.+++$+++L12641+++$+++Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
L12639+++$+++Yeah.+++$+++L12640+++$+++I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
L12638+++$+++I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.+++$+++L12639+++$+++Yeah.
L12637+++$+++I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12636+++$+++Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?+++$+++L12637+++$+++I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
L12635+++$+++Not particularly.+++$+++L12636+++$+++Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
L12634+++$+++It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?+++$+++L12635+++$+++Not particularly.
L12633+++$+++Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12632+++$+++A hunting accident is perfect.+++$+++L12633+++$+++Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
L12631+++$+++So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.+++$+++L12632+++$+++A hunting accident is perfect.
L12630+++$+++Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.+++$+++L12631+++$+++So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
L12629+++$+++Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?+++$+++L12630+++$+++Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
L12628+++$+++Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?+++$+++L12629+++$+++Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
L12627+++$+++I don't know. You tell me.+++$+++L12628+++$+++Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
L12626+++$+++They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?+++$+++L12627+++$+++I don't know. You tell me.
L12625+++$+++Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.+++$+++L12626+++$+++They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
L12624+++$+++Money.+++$+++L12625+++$+++Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
L12623+++$+++Motive. You gotta have a motive.+++$+++L12624+++$+++Money.
L12622+++$+++Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.+++$+++L12623+++$+++Motive. You gotta have a motive.
L12621+++$+++Then who shot him?+++$+++L12622+++$+++Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
L12620+++$+++That it wasn't an accident.+++$+++L12621+++$+++Then who shot him?
L12619+++$+++Which is?+++$+++L12620+++$+++That it wasn't an accident.
L12618+++$+++I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.+++$+++L12619+++$+++Which is?
L12617+++$+++Find them everywhere.+++$+++L12618+++$+++I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
L12616+++$+++Want to know what I think happened?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L12615+++$+++I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.+++$+++L12616+++$+++Want to know what I think happened?

L12612+++$+++Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around.

L19199+++$+++I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L19193+++$+++You mean...+++$+++L19194+++$+++That's right -- premature ejection.
L19192+++$+++Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.+++$+++L19193+++$+++You mean...

L18796+++$+++What word would you use, Elaine?+++$+++L18797+++$+++The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.

L18564+++$+++Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L18524+++$+++Ted, what's wrong?+++$+++L18525+++$+++Ask Simon.
L18512+++$+++I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L18685+++$+++So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.+++$+++L18686+++$+++What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?

L18611+++$+++Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.+++$+++L18612+++$+++We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
L19151+++$+++I'm sure.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19150+++$+++You're sure?+++$+++L19151+++$+++I'm sure.
L19149+++$+++That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.+++$+++L19150+++$+++You're sure?
L19148+++$+++What?+++$+++L19149+++$+++That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
L19147+++$+++Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.+++$+++L19148+++$+++What?
L19146+++$+++I don't want to live anymore.+++$+++L19147+++$+++Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
L19145+++$+++Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.+++$+++L19146+++$+++I don't want to live anymore.
L18875+++$+++Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18874+++$+++Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.+++$+++L18875+++$+++Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
L18768+++$+++Poached!  Not over!  Over!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18767+++$+++All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.+++$+++L18768+++$+++Poached!  Not over!  Over!
L18766+++$+++That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.+++$+++L18767+++$+++All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
L18764+++$+++Just poached on toast.  Over.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18763+++$+++Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.+++$+++L18764+++$+++Just poached on toast.  Over.
L18762+++$+++No.  Poached.  Over.+++$+++L18763+++$+++Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
L18761+++$+++How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.+++$+++L18762+++$+++No.  Poached.  Over.
L18760+++$+++A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.+++$+++L18761+++$+++How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
L19141+++$+++Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19140+++$+++What should I say?+++$+++L19141+++$+++Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
L19139+++$+++No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.+++$+++L19140+++$+++What should I say?
L19138+++$+++A b...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19137+++$+++He's carrying a bomb.+++$+++L19138+++$+++A b...

L19135+++$+++Which passenger is Joe Salucci?+++$+++L19136+++$+++Sixteen 'C', why?
L18682+++$+++Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18681+++$+++Whenever your're ready, Captain.+++$+++L18682+++$+++Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
L18632+++$+++Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18631+++$+++Good to be aboard, gentlemen.+++$+++L18632+++$+++Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
L18598+++$+++Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18597+++$+++That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.+++$+++L18598+++$+++Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
L18593+++$+++We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18592+++$+++Mr. Kurtz, I presume.+++$+++L18593+++$+++We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
L18591+++$+++Captain Oveur?+++$+++L18592+++$+++Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
L18475+++$+++Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18474+++$+++Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.+++$+++L18475+++$+++Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
L18473+++$+++Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.+++$+++L18474+++$+++Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
L18472+++$+++It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.+++$+++L18473+++$+++Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
L18471+++$+++Yes.+++$+++L18472+++$+++It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
L18470+++$+++Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?+++$+++L18471+++$+++Yes.
L18469+++$+++Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.+++$+++L18470+++$+++Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
L18468+++$+++You folks need any help?+++$+++L18469+++$+++Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
L18608+++$+++But that's not a door.  The door's over there.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18607+++$+++Don't try to stop me!+++$+++L18608+++$+++But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
L18606+++$+++You can't go in there!+++$+++L18607+++$+++Don't try to stop me!
L18605+++$+++Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18604+++$+++All right, it's a matter of death.+++$+++L18605+++$+++Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
L18603+++$+++You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.+++$+++L18604+++$+++All right, it's a matter of death.
L18602+++$+++No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.+++$+++L18603+++$+++You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
L18601+++$+++Do you have an appointment, sir?+++$+++L18602+++$+++No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
L18600+++$+++I have to see Bud Kruger.+++$+++L18601+++$+++Do you have an appointment, sir?
L18989+++$+++Pull yourself together!  We've got to...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18988+++$+++Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!+++$+++L18989+++$+++Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
L18987+++$+++Then Elaine was right.+++$+++L18988+++$+++Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
L18986+++$+++That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.+++$+++L18987+++$+++Then Elaine was right.
L18985+++$+++Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?+++$+++L18986+++$+++That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
L18984+++$+++Striker.+++$+++L18985+++$+++Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
L18519+++$+++I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18518+++$+++You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.+++$+++L18519+++$+++I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
L18517+++$+++Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.+++$+++L18518+++$+++You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
L18516+++$+++You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.+++$+++L18517+++$+++Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
L18509+++$+++That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18508+++$+++Are you on the Mercury mission?+++$+++L18509+++$+++That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
L18816+++$+++Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18815+++$+++No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.+++$+++L18816+++$+++Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
L18814+++$+++I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18813+++$+++Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.+++$+++L18814+++$+++I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
L18812+++$+++Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.+++$+++L18813+++$+++Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
L18811+++$+++Not if the people change together in relation to that love.+++$+++L18812+++$+++Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
L18810+++$+++People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.+++$+++L18811+++$+++Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
L18809+++$+++Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.+++$+++L18810+++$+++People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
L18808+++$+++We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.+++$+++L18809+++$+++Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
L18807+++$+++No.  I mean your relationship.+++$+++L18808+++$+++We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
L18806+++$+++I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.+++$+++L18807+++$+++No.  I mean your relationship.
L18805+++$+++Do you want to talk about it.+++$+++L18806+++$+++I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
L18804+++$+++No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18803+++$+++I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.+++$+++L18804+++$+++No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
L18802+++$+++You've been hurt.+++$+++L18803+++$+++I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
L18541+++$+++You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L18540+++$+++I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.+++$+++L18541+++$+++You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
L18539+++$+++Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.+++$+++L18540+++$+++I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
L18538+++$+++Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?+++$+++L18539+++$+++Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
L18537+++$+++You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.+++$+++L18538+++$+++Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
L18536+++$+++Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.+++$+++L18537+++$+++You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
L18535+++$+++Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?+++$+++L18536+++$+++Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
L19838+++$+++That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19837+++$+++Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.+++$+++L19838+++$+++That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
L19836+++$+++No. I'm all alone.+++$+++L19837+++$+++Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
L19835+++$+++I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?+++$+++L19836+++$+++No. I'm all alone.
L19714+++$+++That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19713+++$+++Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.+++$+++L19714+++$+++That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
L19712+++$+++You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.+++$+++L19713+++$+++Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
L19711+++$+++I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.+++$+++L19712+++$+++You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
L19710+++$+++I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.+++$+++L19711+++$+++I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
L19709+++$+++Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.+++$+++L19710+++$+++I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
L19708+++$+++But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?+++$+++L19709+++$+++Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
L19707+++$+++Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.+++$+++L19708+++$+++But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
L19706+++$+++After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.+++$+++L19707+++$+++Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
L19402+++$+++No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19401+++$+++Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?+++$+++L19402+++$+++No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
L19400+++$+++Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?+++$+++L19401+++$+++Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
L19399+++$+++No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.+++$+++L19400+++$+++Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
L19398+++$+++Thank you. Cream?+++$+++L19399+++$+++No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
L19397+++$+++Ah, won't you sit down?+++$+++L19398+++$+++Thank you. Cream?
L19396+++$+++That's very nice of you. Thank you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19395+++$+++I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.+++$+++L19396+++$+++That's very nice of you. Thank you.
L19611+++$+++Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19610+++$+++...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.+++$+++L19611+++$+++Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
L19608+++$+++Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19607+++$+++Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.+++$+++L19608+++$+++Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
L19606+++$+++Something about a plane with no pilot?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19605+++$+++Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.+++$+++L19606+++$+++Something about a plane with no pilot?
L19604+++$+++Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.+++$+++L19605+++$+++Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
L19603+++$+++Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19602+++$+++Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.+++$+++L19603+++$+++Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
L19789+++$+++Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19788+++$+++And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."+++$+++L19789+++$+++Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
L19787+++$+++George Zipp said that?+++$+++L19788+++$+++And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
L19757+++$+++I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19756+++$+++Surely there must be something you can do.+++$+++L19757+++$+++I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
L19755+++$+++I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.+++$+++L19756+++$+++Surely there must be something you can do.
L19754+++$+++Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?+++$+++L19755+++$+++I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
L19753+++$+++Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?+++$+++L19754+++$+++Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
L19736+++$+++Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19735+++$+++...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.+++$+++L19736+++$+++Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
L19653+++$+++Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19652+++$+++Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.+++$+++L19653+++$+++Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
L19633+++$+++Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19632+++$+++I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?+++$+++L19633+++$+++Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
L19631+++$+++Surely you can't be serious.+++$+++L19632+++$+++I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
L19630+++$+++Can you fly this airplane and land it?+++$+++L19631+++$+++Surely you can't be serious.
L19629+++$+++Both pilots!+++$+++L19630+++$+++Can you fly this airplane and land it?
L19554+++$+++I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19553+++$+++What is it, Doctor? What's happening?+++$+++L19554+++$+++I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
L19551+++$+++No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19550+++$+++You can't take a guess for another two hours?+++$+++L19551+++$+++No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
L19549+++$+++Well...not for another two hours.+++$+++L19550+++$+++You can't take a guess for another two hours?
L19548+++$+++Can't you take a guess?+++$+++L19549+++$+++Well...not for another two hours.
L19545+++$+++I can't tell.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19544+++$+++Captain, how soon can we land?+++$+++L19545+++$+++I can't tell.
L19601+++$+++I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19600+++$+++No. No one that I know of.+++$+++L19601+++$+++I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
L19599+++$+++Well...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19598+++$+++All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?+++$+++L19599+++$+++Well...
L19597+++$+++No.+++$+++L19598+++$+++All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
L19596+++$+++Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?+++$+++L19597+++$+++No.
L19576+++$+++Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L19575+++$+++Just how serious is it, doctor?+++$+++L19576+++$+++Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
L19573+++$+++He had fish, too.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L24423+++$+++I like my horizons narrow.+++$+++L24424+++$+++Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
L24422+++$+++I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.+++$+++L24423+++$+++I like my horizons narrow.

L24417+++$+++Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24416+++$+++The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.+++$+++L24417+++$+++Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.

L24412+++$+++Does that cost extra or you throw them in?+++$+++L24413+++$+++You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
L24411+++$+++Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.+++$+++L24412+++$+++Does that cost extra or you throw them in?

L24530+++$+++I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24529+++$+++Lay off, asshole.+++$+++L24530+++$+++I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
L24528+++$+++Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?+++$+++L24529+++$+++Lay off, asshole.
L24526+++$+++I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L24190+++$+++Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?+++$+++L24191+++$+++You don't have squat.
L24189+++$+++So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?+++$+++L24190+++$+++Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
L24655+++$+++No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24654+++$+++Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...+++$+++L24655+++$+++No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
L24316+++$+++That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24315+++$+++You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.+++$+++L24316+++$+++That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
L24314+++$+++Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.+++$+++L24315+++$+++You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
L24309+++$+++Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L24307+++$+++Yes...+++$+++L24308+++$+++I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.

L24639+++$+++Here?+++$+++L24640+++$+++Do it!
L24638+++$+++Kill them both.+++$+++L24639+++$+++Here?
L24464+++$+++This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24463+++$+++When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.+++$+++L24464+++$+++This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
L24326+++$+++It is his new partner that I'm worried about.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24325+++$+++He didn't recognize me.+++$+++L24326+++$+++It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
L24324+++$+++This is becoming a serious breach of security.+++$+++L24325+++$+++He didn't recognize me.
L24323+++$+++That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.+++$+++L24324+++$+++This is becoming a serious breach of security.
L24700+++$+++You look very good.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24699+++$+++How do I look?+++$+++L24700+++$+++You look very good.
L24686+++$+++You understand that.  But how many others will?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24685+++$+++But there's no more drug.+++$+++L24686+++$+++You understand that.  But how many others will?
L24684+++$+++Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.+++$+++L24685+++$+++But there's no more drug.
L24683+++$+++Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?+++$+++L24684+++$+++Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
L24682+++$+++We can't let him get away.+++$+++L24683+++$+++Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
L24681+++$+++I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.+++$+++L24682+++$+++We can't let him get away.
L24680+++$+++Tell me about it...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24679+++$+++No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...+++$+++L24680+++$+++Tell me about it...
L24678+++$+++Harcourt is dead.+++$+++L24679+++$+++No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
L24677+++$+++... It's Harcourt.+++$+++L24678+++$+++Harcourt is dead.
L24676+++$+++What is this?!+++$+++L24677+++$+++... It's Harcourt.
L24672+++$+++Do what?!  George-- ?!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24671+++$+++No!  We must do this alone.+++$+++L24672+++$+++Do what?!  George-- ?!
L24670+++$+++There!  Go back.  Down that side street.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24669+++$+++What's this about, George?  I know that look.+++$+++L24670+++$+++There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
L24657+++$+++It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24656+++$+++With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.+++$+++L24657+++$+++It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
L24651+++$+++Ss-ai!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24650+++$+++Shit!+++$+++L24651+++$+++Ss-ai!
L24610+++$+++Fuck procedure.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24609+++$++++++$+++L24610+++$+++Fuck procedure.
L24608+++$+++Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24607+++$+++The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.+++$+++L24608+++$+++Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
L24606+++$+++George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.+++$+++L24607+++$+++The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
L24599+++$+++Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24598+++$+++George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...+++$+++L24599+++$+++Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
L24594+++$+++Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24593+++$+++Uh, George...+++$+++L24594+++$+++Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
L24588+++$+++No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24587+++$+++If the drug is here, we must destroy it.+++$+++L24588+++$+++No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
L24586+++$+++Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.+++$+++L24587+++$+++If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
L24585+++$+++Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24584+++$+++They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--+++$+++L24585+++$+++Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
L24565+++$+++I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24564+++$+++George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.+++$+++L24565+++$+++I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
L24563+++$+++Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L24561+++$+++No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.+++$+++L24562+++$+++Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
L24560+++$+++Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?+++$+++L24561+++$+++No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
L24559+++$+++We all did.+++$+++L24560+++$+++Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
L24558+++$+++We?  You've taken it?+++$+++L24559+++$+++We all did.
L24557+++$+++Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.+++$+++L24558+++$+++We?  You've taken it?
L24556+++$+++How potent?+++$+++L24557+++$+++Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
L24555+++$+++... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.+++$+++L24556+++$+++How potent?
L24554+++$+++The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?+++$+++L24555+++$+++... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.

L24552+++$+++No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!+++$+++L24553+++$+++No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
L24550+++$+++You must leave me alone on this.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24549+++$+++What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.+++$+++L24550+++$+++You must leave me alone on this.
L24537+++$+++... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L24488+++$+++You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.

L24251+++$+++Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24250+++$+++You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...+++$+++L24251+++$+++Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
L24216+++$+++Don't tell me what to think.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L24215+++$+++Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...+++$+++L24216+++$+++Don't tell me what to think.
L24214+++$+++Granger and Pitts are already on it.+++$+++L24215+++$+++Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...

L24209+++$+++Departmental policy.+++$+++L24210+++$+++You?
L24208+++$+++You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.+++$+++L24209+++$+++Departmental policy.

L24160+++$+++Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.+++$+++L24161+++$+++Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.

L24155+++$+++Does that look at all suspicious to you?+++$+++L24156+++$+++Whatever gave you that idea?
L24153+++$+++Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L24151+++$+++Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--+++$+++L24152+++$+++But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
L24150+++$+++Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?

L26484+++$+++Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.+++$+++L26485+++$+++Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

L26971+++$+++You did okay, Bishop.+++$+++L26972+++$+++Well, thanks, I --

L26808+++$+++See you soon.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26807+++$+++It's going to be closer.  You better get going.+++$+++L26808+++$+++See you soon.
L26803+++$+++All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26802+++$+++I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.+++$+++L26803+++$+++All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
L26801+++$+++What?+++$+++L26802+++$+++I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
L26800+++$+++I'll go.+++$+++L26801+++$+++What?
L26789+++$+++I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26788+++$+++And it's too late to shut it down?+++$+++L26789+++$+++I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
L26785+++$+++I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26784+++$+++How long until it blows?+++$+++L26785+++$+++I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
L26783+++$+++That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.+++$+++L26784+++$+++How long until it blows?
L26759+++$+++Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26758+++$+++Could it be intelligent?+++$+++L26759+++$+++Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
L26757+++$+++Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.+++$+++L26758+++$+++Could it be intelligent?
L26756+++$+++You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?+++$+++L26757+++$+++Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
L26755+++$+++That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.+++$+++L26756+++$+++You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
L26754+++$+++But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.+++$+++L26755+++$+++That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
L26753+++$+++Yes.  That follows.+++$+++L26754+++$+++But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
L26752+++$+++Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.+++$+++L26753+++$+++Yes.  That follows.
L26751+++$+++Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26750+++$+++I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.+++$+++L26751+++$+++Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
L26774+++$+++Sorry to disappoint you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26773+++$+++I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.+++$+++L26774+++$+++Sorry to disappoint you.
L26770+++$+++Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26769+++$+++You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?+++$+++L26770+++$+++Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
L26768+++$+++You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26767+++$+++Now, wait a second --+++$+++L26768+++$+++You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
L26766+++$+++But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --+++$+++L26767+++$+++Now, wait a second --
L26765+++$+++You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.+++$+++L26766+++$+++But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
L26764+++$+++You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.+++$+++L26765+++$+++You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
L26763+++$+++Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.+++$+++L26764+++$+++You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
L26682+++$+++This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26681+++$+++Corporal Hicks!?+++$+++L26682+++$+++This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
L26680+++$+++What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.+++$+++L26681+++$+++Corporal Hicks!?
L26679+++$+++Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.+++$+++L26680+++$+++What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
L26678+++$+++You son of a bitch.+++$+++L26679+++$+++Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
L26673+++$+++Bullshit!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26672+++$+++This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --+++$+++L26673+++$+++Bullshit!
L26671+++$+++They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?+++$+++L26672+++$+++This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
L26670+++$+++Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --+++$+++L26671+++$+++They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
L26669+++$+++Why not?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26668+++$+++Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.+++$+++L26669+++$+++Why not?
L26667+++$+++No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.+++$+++L26668+++$+++Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
L26597+++$+++She's right.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26596+++$+++That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.+++$+++L26597+++$+++She's right.
L26595+++$+++Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...+++$+++L26596+++$+++That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
L26594+++$+++They're right under the primary heat exchangers.+++$+++L26595+++$+++Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
L26476+++$+++Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26475+++$+++That the atmosphere processor?+++$+++L26476+++$+++Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
L26442+++$+++I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26441+++$+++I hope you're right.  I really do.+++$+++L26442+++$+++I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
L26408+++$+++Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26407+++$+++You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?+++$+++L26408+++$+++Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
L26378+++$+++That's the plan.  My word on it.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26377+++$+++Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.+++$+++L26378+++$+++That's the plan.  My word on it.
L26376+++$+++Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...+++$+++L26377+++$+++Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
L26374+++$+++No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26373+++$+++Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...+++$+++L26374+++$+++No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
L26372+++$+++Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26371+++$+++If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...+++$+++L26372+++$+++Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
L26370+++$+++If I go.+++$+++L26371+++$+++If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
L26369+++$+++What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?+++$+++L26370+++$+++If I go.
L26368+++$+++It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.+++$+++L26369+++$+++What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
L26367+++$+++Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?+++$+++L26368+++$+++It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
L26366+++$+++That's right.+++$+++L26367+++$+++Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
L26365+++$+++I heard you were working in the cargo docks.+++$+++L26366+++$+++That's right.
L26364+++$+++Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.+++$+++L26365+++$+++I heard you were working in the cargo docks.

L26286+++$+++I get the picture.+++$+++L26287+++$+++Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.

L26738+++$+++No, it's different, honey.+++$+++L26739+++$+++Did you ever have a baby?
L26737+++$+++Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?+++$+++L26738+++$+++No, it's different, honey.

L26735+++$+++Did one of those things grow inside her?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L26580+++$+++You're really something, ace.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L26314+++$+++What are you talking about. What people?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26313+++$+++Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.+++$+++L26314+++$+++What are you talking about. What people?
L26312+++$+++Why won't you check out LV-426?+++$+++L26313+++$+++Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.

L26302+++$+++Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...+++$+++L26303+++$+++Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
L26297+++$+++That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L26296+++$+++The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...+++$+++L26297+++$+++That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.

L31141+++$+++I can't write it!+++$+++L31142+++$+++Why not?

L31069+++$+++I'm not telling you.+++$+++L31070+++$+++Why not?
L31068+++$+++What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?+++$+++L31069+++$+++I'm not telling you.

L30935+++$+++Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him.

L30932+++$+++Wolfi.+++$+++L30933+++$+++Yes, my love?
L30931+++$+++We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.+++$+++L30932+++$+++Wolfi.

L30728+++$+++Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -+++$+++L30729+++$+++Stanzi!

L30665+++$+++Wolfi!+++$+++L30666+++$+++What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
L30664+++$+++Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?+++$+++L30665+++$+++Wolfi!
L30663+++$+++May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?+++$+++L30664+++$+++Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?

L30654+++$+++Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.+++$+++L30655+++$+++He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.

L30502+++$+++Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.+++$+++L30503+++$+++What's the matter with you?
L30501+++$+++Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.+++$+++L30502+++$+++Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.

L30411+++$+++Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.+++$+++L30412+++$+++This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
L30410+++$+++All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?+++$+++L30411+++$+++Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
L30409+++$+++Don't be stupid.+++$+++L30410+++$+++All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
L30408+++$+++How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?+++$+++L30409+++$+++Don't be stupid.
L30407+++$+++Well, don't do that again!+++$+++L30408+++$+++How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
L30406+++$+++Yes!+++$+++L30407+++$+++Well, don't do that again!
L30405+++$+++You borrowed money from your mother?+++$+++L30406+++$+++Yes!

L30402+++$+++No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.+++$+++L30403+++$+++Oh yes? You always know everything.
L30401+++$+++They'll come anyway. They love me here.+++$+++L30402+++$+++No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
L30400+++$+++One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!+++$+++L30401+++$+++They'll come anyway. They love me here.
L30399+++$+++Oh, leave me alone.+++$+++L30400+++$+++One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!

L30062+++$+++Do you think that's funny?+++$+++L30063+++$+++Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
L30061+++$+++Why? People fart backwards.+++$+++L30062+++$+++Do you think that's funny?
L30060+++$+++That's stupid.+++$+++L30061+++$+++Why? People fart backwards.
L30059+++$+++Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.+++$+++L30060+++$+++That's stupid.
L30058+++$+++Why not?+++$+++L30059+++$+++Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.

L31323+++$+++No. I was assisting him. He asked me.+++$+++L31324+++$+++He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
L31322+++$+++This is not his handwriting.+++$+++L31323+++$+++No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
L31317+++$+++And I'm asking you -+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31316+++$+++He asked me to stay.+++$+++L31317+++$+++And I'm asking you -
L31315+++$+++No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.+++$+++L31316+++$+++He asked me to stay.
L31314+++$+++He needs me, ma'am.+++$+++L31315+++$+++No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.

L31311+++$+++Why you?+++$+++L31312+++$+++I was at hand.
L31310+++$+++Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.+++$+++L31311+++$+++Why you?
L31309+++$+++What are you doing here?+++$+++L31310+++$+++Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.

L30480+++$+++I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?+++$+++L30481+++$+++What?
L30464+++$+++Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30463+++$+++But! I'm a married woman!+++$+++L30464+++$+++Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
L30462+++$+++It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.+++$+++L30463+++$+++But! I'm a married woman!
L30461+++$+++Isn't it obvious?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30460+++$+++What do you mean?+++$+++L30461+++$+++Isn't it obvious?
L30459+++$+++Some service deserves service in return. No?+++$+++L30460+++$+++What do you mean?
L30458+++$+++What for?+++$+++L30459+++$+++Some service deserves service in return. No?
L30457+++$+++Alone.+++$+++L30458+++$+++What for?
L30456+++$+++Tonight?+++$+++L30457+++$+++Alone.
L30455+++$+++Come back tonight.+++$+++L30456+++$+++Tonight?
L30454+++$+++Oh, thank you, sir!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30453+++$+++Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.+++$+++L30454+++$+++Oh, thank you, sir!
L30451+++$+++Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30450+++$+++It is miraculous.+++$+++L30451+++$+++Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
L30445+++$+++Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30444+++$+++These are originals?+++$+++L30445+++$+++Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
L30443+++$+++Yes.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30442+++$+++Originals?+++$+++L30443+++$+++Yes.
L30441+++$+++That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.+++$+++L30442+++$+++Originals?
L30440+++$+++Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.+++$+++L30441+++$+++That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
L30439+++$+++Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L30434+++$+++Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post.

L30433+++$+++I see.+++$+++L30434+++$+++Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn.

L30432+++$+++No, sir. This is my own idea.+++$+++L30433+++$+++I see.
L30431+++$+++Then he didn't send you?+++$+++L30432+++$+++No, sir. This is my own idea.
L30430+++$+++My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.+++$+++L30431+++$+++Then he didn't send you?
L30429+++$+++Really?+++$+++L30430+++$+++My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
L30428+++$+++I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.+++$+++L30429+++$+++Really?
L30427+++$+++I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.+++$+++L30428+++$+++I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
L30426+++$+++Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.+++$+++L30427+++$+++I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
L30425+++$+++I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.+++$+++L30426+++$+++Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
L30424+++$+++I understand.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L31114+++$+++You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.+++$+++L31115+++$+++Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
L31113+++$+++Money! Money!+++$+++L31114+++$+++You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
L31112+++$+++Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?+++$+++L31113+++$+++Money! Money!
L31111+++$+++You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!+++$+++L31112+++$+++Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
L31110+++$+++I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!+++$+++L31111+++$+++You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
L31109+++$+++He's doing his best.+++$+++L31110+++$+++I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
L31108+++$+++I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?+++$+++L31109+++$+++He's doing his best.
L31107+++$+++Leave him alone!+++$+++L31108+++$+++I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
L31106+++$+++Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?+++$+++L31107+++$+++Leave him alone!
L31085+++$+++I hope so. I need it immediately.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31084+++$+++He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.+++$+++L31085+++$+++I hope so. I need it immediately.
L31083+++$+++Where's our friend?+++$+++L31084+++$+++He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
L31082+++$+++Not at all.+++$+++L31083+++$+++Where's our friend?
L31081+++$+++Am I interrupting something?+++$+++L31082+++$+++Not at all.
L31017+++$+++Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31016+++$+++How much will you pay him?+++$+++L31017+++$+++Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
L30740+++$+++Do you hear him? Do you?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30739+++$+++So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.+++$+++L30740+++$+++Do you hear him? Do you?
L30738+++$+++Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!+++$+++L30739+++$+++So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
L30737+++$+++And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?+++$+++L30738+++$+++Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
L30736+++$+++And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.+++$+++L30737+++$+++And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
L30723+++$+++Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30722+++$+++But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!+++$+++L30723+++$+++Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
L30721+++$+++What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.+++$+++L30722+++$+++But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
L30659+++$+++In three months! Papa.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30658+++$+++When, may I ask?+++$+++L30659+++$+++In three months! Papa.
L30657+++$+++Oh, yes.+++$+++L30658+++$+++When, may I ask?

L30267+++$+++I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.+++$+++L30268+++$+++Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
L30264+++$+++Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30263+++$+++I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.+++$+++L30264+++$+++Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
L30262+++$+++Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!+++$+++L30263+++$+++I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
L30261+++$+++I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.+++$+++L30262+++$+++Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
L30260+++$+++Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.+++$+++L30261+++$+++I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
L30617+++$+++Yes. He is a little strange.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30616+++$+++What a strange young man.+++$+++L30617+++$+++Yes. He is a little strange.
L30606+++$+++Michael!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30605+++$+++I said play!+++$+++L30606+++$+++Michael!
L30582+++$+++Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30581+++$+++People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.+++$+++L30582+++$+++Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
L30580+++$+++It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.+++$+++L30581+++$+++People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
L30579+++$+++Gertrude!+++$+++L30580+++$+++It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
L30578+++$+++I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.+++$+++L30579+++$+++Gertrude!
L30575+++$+++You can't be Herr Mozart!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30574+++$+++Gertrude!+++$+++L30575+++$+++You can't be Herr Mozart!
L30573+++$+++Upstairs.+++$+++L30574+++$+++Gertrude!
L30602+++$+++Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30601+++$+++I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.+++$+++L30602+++$+++Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
L30600+++$+++Who was your teacher?+++$+++L30601+++$+++I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
L30599+++$+++Just one year.+++$+++L30600+++$+++Who was your teacher?
L30589+++$+++Wine?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30588+++$+++I'd like a little wine, if you have it.+++$+++L30589+++$+++Wine?
L30587+++$+++Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?+++$+++L30588+++$+++I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
L30584+++$+++Ah, now! Here she comes.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30583+++$+++Really?+++$+++L30584+++$+++Ah, now! Here she comes.
L30889+++$+++Well, look at them.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30888+++$+++It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.+++$+++L30889+++$+++Well, look at them.
L30887+++$+++Do you like this, Salieri?+++$+++L30888+++$+++It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
L30521+++$+++Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30520+++$+++Yes?+++$+++L30521+++$+++Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
L30519+++$+++As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!+++$+++L30520+++$+++Yes?
L30518+++$+++Really?+++$+++L30519+++$+++As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
L30517+++$+++I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.+++$+++L30518+++$+++Really?
L30516+++$+++Of course not.+++$+++L30517+++$+++I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
L30515+++$+++Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.+++$+++L30516+++$+++Of course not.
L30514+++$+++Oh?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30513+++$+++Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.+++$+++L30514+++$+++Oh?
L30512+++$+++Why not?+++$+++L30513+++$+++Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
L30511+++$+++Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.+++$+++L30512+++$+++Why not?
L30510+++$+++I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.+++$+++L30511+++$+++Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
L30378+++$+++Well. There it is.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30377+++$+++Sire.+++$+++L30378+++$+++Well. There it is.
L30376+++$+++You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.+++$+++L30377+++$+++Sire.
L30375+++$+++I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.+++$+++L30376+++$+++You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
L30374+++$+++Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.+++$+++L30375+++$+++I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
L30373+++$+++Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.+++$+++L30374+++$+++Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
L30372+++$+++And the result satisfies.+++$+++L30373+++$+++Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
L30371+++$+++You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.+++$+++L30372+++$+++And the result satisfies.
L30370+++$+++Yes?+++$+++L30371+++$+++You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
L30369+++$+++An interesting idea, Majesty. But -+++$+++L30370+++$+++Yes?
L30368+++$+++I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30367+++$+++Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!+++$+++L30368+++$+++I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
L30365+++$+++Your Highness.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30364+++$+++Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.+++$+++L30365+++$+++Your Highness.
L30204+++$+++Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30203+++$+++Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.+++$+++L30204+++$+++Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
L30202+++$+++Well, I'm glad to hear that.+++$+++L30203+++$+++Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
L30179+++$+++Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30178+++$+++My pleasure.+++$+++L30179+++$+++Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
L30170+++$+++Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30169+++$+++And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.+++$+++L30170+++$+++Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
L30156+++$+++Ah-ha!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30155+++$+++A-flat, Majesty.+++$+++L30156+++$+++Ah-ha!
L30154+++$+++Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30153+++$+++You do me too much honour, Sire.+++$+++L30154+++$+++Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
L30152+++$+++Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?+++$+++L30153+++$+++You do me too much honour, Sire.
L30151+++$+++Majesty.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30150+++$+++May I try it?+++$+++L30151+++$+++Majesty.
L30149+++$+++It's just a trifle, of course.+++$+++L30150+++$+++May I try it?
L30148+++$+++What a charming idea. May I see?+++$+++L30149+++$+++It's just a trifle, of course.
L30124+++$+++You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30123+++$+++I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.+++$+++L30124+++$+++You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
L30833+++$+++Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30832+++$+++You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.+++$+++L30833+++$+++Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
L30831+++$+++Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.+++$+++L30832+++$+++You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
L30821+++$+++Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30820+++$+++Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!+++$+++L30821+++$+++Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
L30819+++$+++Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.+++$+++L30820+++$+++Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
L30818+++$+++I have no idea.+++$+++L30819+++$+++Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
L30817+++$+++But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?+++$+++L30818+++$+++I have no idea.
L30816+++$+++Ah, love again.+++$+++L30817+++$+++But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation.

How long do you think I can sustain that?
L30815+++$+++But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.+++$+++L30816+++$+++Ah, love again.
L30814+++$+++I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30813+++$+++Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.+++$+++L30814+++$+++I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
L30812+++$+++Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.+++$+++L30813+++$+++Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
L30809+++$+++Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30808+++$+++Would you tell me why?+++$+++L30809+++$+++Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
L30807+++$+++Well, yes, I admit it is.+++$+++L30808+++$+++Would you tell me why?
L30806+++$+++It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?+++$+++L30807+++$+++Well, yes, I admit it is.
L30805+++$+++Who told you this, Majesty?+++$+++L30806+++$+++It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
L30804+++$+++Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?+++$+++L30805+++$+++Who told you this, Majesty?
L30803+++$+++Yes, Sire.+++$+++L30804+++$+++Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
L30802+++$+++Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?+++$+++L30803+++$+++Yes, Sire.
L30768+++$+++Ah! By all means.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30767+++$+++May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.+++$+++L30768+++$+++Ah! By all means.
L30766+++$+++What is it?+++$+++L30767+++$+++May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
L30765+++$+++Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?+++$+++L30766+++$+++What is it?
L30762+++$+++Thank you, Sire!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30761+++$+++Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.+++$+++L30762+++$+++Thank you, Sire!
L30296+++$+++Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30295+++$+++Twenty-six.+++$+++L30296+++$+++Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
L30294+++$+++Excuse me, but how old are you?+++$+++L30295+++$+++Twenty-six.
L30293+++$+++Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30292+++$+++Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?+++$+++L30293+++$+++Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
L30290+++$+++Enchanted, Madame.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30289+++$+++Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.+++$+++L30290+++$+++Enchanted, Madame.
L30285+++$+++Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30284+++$+++My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.+++$+++L30285+++$+++Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
L30281+++$+++My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30280+++$+++I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.+++$+++L30281+++$+++My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
L30277+++$+++Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30276+++$+++What do you mean, Sire?+++$+++L30277+++$+++Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
L30275+++$+++Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.+++$+++L30276+++$+++What do you mean, Sire?
L30274+++$+++So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?+++$+++L30275+++$+++Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
L30273+++$+++Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!+++$+++L30274+++$+++So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
L30272+++$+++And German?+++$+++L30273+++$+++Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
L30271+++$+++Yes, indeed.+++$+++L30272+++$+++And German?
L30270+++$+++It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?+++$+++L30271+++$+++Yes, indeed.
L30213+++$+++I think so, Sire, yes.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30212+++$+++What? On one hearing only?+++$+++L30213+++$+++I think so, Sire, yes.
L30211+++$+++Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.+++$+++L30212+++$+++What? On one hearing only?
L30195+++$+++Ah-ha.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30194+++$+++In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.+++$+++L30195+++$+++Ah-ha.
L30193+++$+++Yes, where?+++$+++L30194+++$+++In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
L30192+++$+++It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30191+++$+++Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.+++$+++L30192+++$+++It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -

L31037+++$+++What for?+++$+++L31038+++$+++If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
L31036+++$+++Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?+++$+++L31037+++$+++What for?
L31035+++$+++What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?+++$+++L31036+++$+++Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
L31034+++$+++Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?+++$+++L31035+++$+++What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
L31033+++$+++Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.+++$+++L31034+++$+++Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?

L31031+++$+++Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?+++$+++L31032+++$+++Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
L30615+++$+++Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L30576+++$+++I'm afraid I am.+++$+++L30577+++$+++Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?

They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.+++$+++L30567+++$+++And which one of them do you want me to teach?

L31256+++$+++Strange!+++$+++L31257+++$+++Come. Let's begin.
L31255+++$+++Oh, yes.+++$+++L31256+++$+++Strange!
L31254+++$+++A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?+++$+++L31255+++$+++Oh, yes.
L31253+++$+++What?+++$+++L31254+++$+++A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?

L31250+++$+++So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?+++$+++L31251+++$+++Consigned to flames of woe.
L31249+++$+++The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.+++$+++L31250+++$+++So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
L31248+++$+++Where did I stop?+++$+++L31249+++$+++The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
L31238+++$+++A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31237+++$+++Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?+++$+++L31238+++$+++A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
L31236+++$+++You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.+++$+++L31237+++$+++Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
L31235+++$+++Of course.+++$+++L31236+++$+++You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
L31234+++$+++But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.+++$+++L31235+++$+++Of course.
L31233+++$+++My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.+++$+++L31234+++$+++But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
L31232+++$+++Would you? Actually, you could.+++$+++L31233+++$+++My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.

L31207+++$+++What man?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31206+++$+++The man. He's here.+++$+++L31207+++$+++What man?
L31205+++$+++Who?+++$+++L31206+++$+++The man. He's here.

L31201+++$+++What?+++$+++L31202+++$+++I'm too young to be so sick.
L31200+++$+++The doctor thinks I am. But -+++$+++L31201+++$+++What?
L31199+++$+++Are you ill?+++$+++L31200+++$+++The doctor thinks I am. But -

L31197+++$+++I do.+++$+++L31198+++$+++I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
L31196+++$+++Do you mean that?+++$+++L31197+++$+++I do.
L31195+++$+++Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.+++$+++L31196+++$+++Do you mean that?
L31194+++$+++This is only a vaudeville.+++$+++L31195+++$+++Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
L31193+++$+++I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.+++$+++L31194+++$+++This is only a vaudeville.
L31192+++$+++I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L31052+++$+++I have come to commission work from you.+++$+++L31053+++$+++What work?
L30929+++$+++Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30928+++$+++You flatter me.+++$+++L30929+++$+++Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!

L30926+++$+++Yes?+++$+++L30927+++$+++I never knew that music like that was possible.
L30925+++$+++How could it not, Excellency?+++$+++L30926+++$+++Yes?
L30924+++$+++Did my work please you?+++$+++L30925+++$+++How could it not, Excellency?
L30923+++$+++How could I not?+++$+++L30924+++$+++Did my work please you?
L30922+++$+++Mozart. It was good of you to come.+++$+++L30923+++$+++How could I not?
L30915+++$+++Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30914+++$+++Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!+++$+++L30915+++$+++Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
L30913+++$+++Oh no, the honour would be all mine.+++$+++L30914+++$+++Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
L30912+++$+++I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.+++$+++L30913+++$+++Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
L30911+++$+++I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.+++$+++L30912+++$+++I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
L30910+++$+++I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?+++$+++L30911+++$+++I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
L30909+++$+++It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?+++$+++L30910+++$+++I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?

L30907+++$+++What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?+++$+++L30908+++$+++I think it's marvelous. Truly.
L30906+++$+++Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.+++$+++L30907+++$+++What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
L30905+++$+++But what is it they don't like?+++$+++L30906+++$+++Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
L30904+++$+++I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.+++$+++L30905+++$+++But what is it they don't like?
L30903+++$+++Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.+++$+++L30904+++$+++I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.

L30879+++$+++With all my heart, Mozart.+++$+++L30880+++$+++Thank you! Oh, thank you.
L30878+++$+++Oh, Excellency, would you?+++$+++L30879+++$+++With all my heart, Mozart.
L30877+++$+++But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.+++$+++L30878+++$+++Oh, Excellency, would you?
L30876+++$+++It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.+++$+++L30877+++$+++But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
L30875+++$+++How fortunate.+++$+++L30876+++$+++It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
L30874+++$+++Oh no! My wife took it out in time.+++$+++L30875+++$+++How fortunate.
L30873+++$+++You burned the score?+++$+++L30874+++$+++Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
L30872+++$+++Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!+++$+++L30873+++$+++You burned the score?
L30871+++$+++Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.+++$+++L30872+++$+++Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
L30870+++$+++I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?+++$+++L30871+++$+++Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
L30869+++$+++Really? Why?+++$+++L30870+++$+++I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
L30868+++$+++It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.+++$+++L30869+++$+++Really? Why?
L30867+++$+++Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?+++$+++L30868+++$+++It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
L30565+++$+++I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30564+++$+++I can't say. Really+++$+++L30565+++$+++I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
L30563+++$+++What exactly are you working on?+++$+++L30564+++$+++I can't say. Really
L30562+++$+++Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?+++$+++L30563+++$+++What exactly are you working on?

L30024+++$+++Is it true?+++$+++L30025+++$+++Do you believe it?
L30023+++$+++And do they believe it?+++$+++L30024+++$+++Is it true?
L30022+++$+++All Vienna has heard that.+++$+++L30023+++$+++And do they believe it?
L30021+++$+++Ah - you've heard that?+++$+++L30022+++$+++All Vienna has heard that.
L30020+++$+++Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.+++$+++L30021+++$+++Ah - you've heard that?
L30019+++$+++I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?+++$+++L30020+++$+++Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
L30018+++$+++Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.+++$+++L30019+++$+++I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
L30017+++$+++Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30016+++$+++I regret it is not too familiar.+++$+++L30017+++$+++Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
L30015+++$+++Well?+++$+++L30016+++$+++I regret it is not too familiar.
L30013+++$+++I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30012+++$+++I can't say I do. What is it?+++$+++L30013+++$+++I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
L30011+++$+++Then you must know this.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30010+++$+++Here in Vienna.+++$+++L30011+++$+++Then you must know this.
L30009+++$+++Where?+++$+++L30010+++$+++Here in Vienna.
L30008+++$+++I know a little. I studied it in my youth.+++$+++L30009+++$+++Where?
L30007+++$+++How well are you trained in music?+++$+++L30008+++$+++I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
L30006+++$+++My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.+++$+++L30007+++$+++How well are you trained in music?

L30002+++$+++That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.+++$+++L30003+++$+++Are they?

L29996+++$+++In the sight of God that is a sin.+++$+++L29997+++$+++What do you want?
L29995+++$+++So?+++$+++L29996+++$+++In the sight of God that is a sin.
L29994+++$+++You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?+++$+++L29995+++$+++So?
L29993+++$+++About what?+++$+++L29994+++$+++You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
L29992+++$+++I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.+++$+++L29993+++$+++About what?

L30852+++$+++Yes, in the third act.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30851+++$+++Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?+++$+++L30852+++$+++Yes, in the third act.
L30850+++$+++Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?+++$+++L30851+++$+++Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
L30849+++$+++Ballet? What ballet?+++$+++L30850+++$+++Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
L30848+++$+++About the ballet.+++$+++L30849+++$+++Ballet? What ballet?
L30847+++$+++What anger?+++$+++L30848+++$+++About the ballet.
L30844+++$+++The Emperor has given him permission.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30843+++$+++Incredible.+++$+++L30844+++$+++The Emperor has given him permission.
L30842+++$+++Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.+++$+++L30843+++$+++Incredible.
L30794+++$+++Never mind.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30793+++$+++Where?+++$+++L30794+++$+++Never mind.
L30792+++$+++I've seen the manuscript.+++$+++L30793+++$+++Where?
L30791+++$+++Are you absolutely sure?+++$+++L30792+++$+++I've seen the manuscript.
L30787+++$+++You must be mad.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30786+++$+++Yes.+++$+++L30787+++$+++You must be mad.

L30784+++$+++Exactly.+++$+++L30785+++$+++He's setting that play to music?
L30783+++$+++You mean that play?+++$+++L30784+++$+++Exactly.
L30780+++$+++Italian?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30779+++$+++Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.+++$+++L30780+++$+++Italian?
L30778+++$+++Yes?+++$+++L30779+++$+++Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
L30777+++$+++I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.+++$+++L30778+++$+++Yes?
L30799+++$+++Ah.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30798+++$+++Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.+++$+++L30799+++$+++Ah.
L30797+++$+++Oh yes, yes. And that was?+++$+++L30798+++$+++Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
L30796+++$+++For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.+++$+++L30797+++$+++Oh yes, yes. And that was?
L30795+++$+++I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?+++$+++L30796+++$+++For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
L30183+++$+++Did we?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30182+++$+++Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.+++$+++L30183+++$+++Did we?
L30159+++$+++Well done, Sire!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30158+++$+++Bravo, Your Majesty!+++$+++L30159+++$+++Well done, Sire!
L31180+++$+++Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31179+++$+++Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?+++$+++L31180+++$+++Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
L31178+++$+++Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31177+++$+++What do you mean - now?+++$+++L31178+++$+++Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
L31176+++$+++Well, promise then.+++$+++L31177+++$+++What do you mean - now?
L31175+++$+++I can't wait.+++$+++L31176+++$+++Well, promise then.
L31174+++$+++Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.+++$+++L31175+++$+++I can't wait.
L31173+++$+++Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31172+++$+++I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.+++$+++L31173+++$+++Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
L31171+++$+++What? Who the devil are you?+++$+++L31172+++$+++I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
L31170+++$+++Here I am, my angel.+++$+++L31171+++$+++What? Who the devil are you?
L31050+++$+++Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31049+++$+++How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.+++$+++L31050+++$+++Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
L31048+++$+++No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.+++$+++L31049+++$+++How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
L31047+++$+++Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?+++$+++L31048+++$+++No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna.

L31046+++$+++I agree, Baron.+++$+++L31047+++$+++Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
L31045+++$+++This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.+++$+++L31046+++$+++I agree, Baron.
L30526+++$+++Come with me. And stay in the room.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30525+++$+++He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.+++$+++L30526+++$+++Come with me. And stay in the room.
L30524+++$+++What does he want?+++$+++L30525+++$+++He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
L30478+++$+++Show her in. Then go to bed.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30477+++$+++That lady is back, sir.+++$+++L30478+++$+++Show her in. Then go to bed.
L30417+++$+++Excuse me, my dear.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L30416+++$+++She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.+++$+++L30417+++$+++Excuse me, my dear.
L30415+++$+++Who is she?+++$+++L30416+++$+++She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
L30414+++$+++Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.+++$+++L30415+++$+++Who is she?
L31226+++$+++Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31225+++$+++Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?+++$+++L31226+++$+++Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
L31223+++$+++Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31222+++$+++I'll call tomorrow.+++$+++L31223+++$+++Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
L31221+++$+++Bene.+++$+++L31222+++$+++I'll call tomorrow.
L31220+++$+++And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.+++$+++L31221+++$+++Bene.
L31219+++$+++Of course.+++$+++L31220+++$+++And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
L31218+++$+++Well, tell him we were here, won't you?+++$+++L31219+++$+++Of course.
L31217+++$+++Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.+++$+++L31218+++$+++Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
L31216+++$+++But he's all right?+++$+++L31217+++$+++Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
L31215+++$+++Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.+++$+++L31216+++$+++But he's all right?
L31214+++$+++Can we come in?+++$+++L31215+++$+++Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
L31213+++$+++Yes, I am looking after him.+++$+++L31214+++$+++Can we come in?
L31212+++$+++Herr Salieri.+++$+++L31213+++$+++Yes, I am looking after him.
L31667+++$+++Thank you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31666+++$+++I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.+++$+++L31667+++$+++Thank you.
L31665+++$+++You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?+++$+++L31666+++$+++I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
L31664+++$+++What do you mean, 'how did he look'?+++$+++L31665+++$+++You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
L31663+++$+++How did he look?+++$+++L31664+++$+++What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
L31662+++$+++The American? Yes, duck.+++$+++L31663+++$+++How did he look?
L31661+++$+++Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?+++$+++L31662+++$+++The American? Yes, duck.
L32200+++$+++I doubt it. But it's something to do.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L32199+++$+++David?+++$+++L32200+++$+++I doubt it. But it's something to do.
L32198+++$+++Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.+++$+++L32199+++$+++David?
L32135+++$+++Tea would be nice.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L32134+++$+++What shall we do?+++$+++L32135+++$+++Tea would be nice.
L32060+++$+++I expect you shortly.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L32059+++$+++No, a cab will be faster.+++$+++L32060+++$+++I expect you shortly.
L32058+++$+++Shall I send a car?+++$+++L32059+++$+++No, a cab will be faster.
L32057+++$+++He's fine. We'll come right over.+++$+++L32058+++$+++Shall I send a car?
L32056+++$+++You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?+++$+++L32057+++$+++He's fine. We'll come right over.
L32055+++$+++Yes, Doctor.+++$+++L32056+++$+++You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
L32054+++$+++Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?+++$+++L32055+++$+++Yes, Doctor.
L32053+++$+++Yes, I should think so.+++$+++L32054+++$+++Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
L32052+++$+++Could you get here without any trouble?+++$+++L32053+++$+++Yes, I should think so.
L32051+++$+++No, not really.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L32050+++$+++Is David acting strangely?+++$+++L32051+++$+++No, not really.
L32049+++$+++No, why?+++$+++L32050+++$+++Is David acting strangely?
L32048+++$+++Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?+++$+++L32049+++$+++No, why?
L32047+++$+++Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.+++$+++L32048+++$+++Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
L32046+++$+++The zoo? Is he rational?+++$+++L32047+++$+++Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
L32045+++$+++He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.+++$+++L32046+++$+++The zoo? Is he rational?
L32044+++$+++Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?+++$+++L32045+++$+++He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
L32043+++$+++He's here.+++$+++L32044+++$+++Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
L31993+++$+++Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31992+++$+++What shall we do?+++$+++L31993+++$+++Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
L31991+++$+++Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.+++$+++L31992+++$+++What shall we do?
L31990+++$+++Dr. Hirsch?+++$+++L31991+++$+++Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
L31989+++$+++David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor.

L31988+++$+++Surely you're not suggesting...+++$+++L31989+++$+++David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
L31987+++$+++No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31986+++$+++You've absolutely no idea where David might be?+++$+++L31987+++$+++No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
L31985+++$+++I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31984+++$+++And what else?+++$+++L31985+++$+++I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
L31983+++$+++They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.+++$+++L31984+++$+++And what else?
L31982+++$+++Yes.+++$+++L31983+++$+++They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
L31981+++$+++I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.+++$+++L31982+++$+++Yes.
L31980+++$+++Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?+++$+++L31981+++$+++I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records.

L31977+++$+++What did he say?+++$+++L31978+++$+++David says Jack comes to warn him.
L31976+++$+++Yes.+++$+++L31977+++$+++What did he say?
L31975+++$+++Has his friend appeared to him again?+++$+++L31976+++$+++Yes.
L31974+++$+++Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.+++$+++L31975+++$+++Has his friend appeared to him again?
L31973+++$+++Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?+++$+++L31974+++$+++Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
L31972+++$+++He's not?+++$+++L31973+++$+++Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?

L31966+++$+++Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.+++$+++L31967+++$+++Yes, sir.
L31962+++$+++Come to my office, Miss Price.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31961+++$+++It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.+++$+++L31962+++$+++Come to my office, Miss Price.
L31591+++$+++Yes, I believe he did.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31590+++$+++Did he say a wolf?+++$+++L31591+++$+++Yes, I believe he did.
L31557+++$+++No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31556+++$+++The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.+++$+++L31557+++$+++No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
L31555+++$+++What happened to them?+++$+++L31556+++$+++The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
L31554+++$+++That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.+++$+++L31555+++$+++What happened to them?
L31553+++$+++He said 'Jack'.+++$+++L31554+++$+++That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
L31552+++$+++What exactly did he call out?+++$+++L31553+++$+++He said 'Jack'.
L31551+++$+++Yes, Doctor?+++$+++L31552+++$+++What exactly did he call out?

L32094+++$+++All right, you two, move along.+++$+++L32095+++$+++Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
L32089+++$+++You did, did you?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L32088+++$+++Officer, I killed those people last night.+++$+++L32089+++$+++You did, did you?
L32171+++$+++Why are you doing this to me?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L32170+++$+++No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.+++$+++L32171+++$+++Why are you doing this to me?
L32169+++$+++That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.+++$+++L32170+++$+++No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
L32161+++$+++You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L31429+++$+++That's very funny, that is.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31428+++$+++Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.+++$+++L31429+++$+++That's very funny, that is.
L31421+++$+++No. You've had your chance.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L31635+++$+++Alex?+++$+++L31636+++$+++Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
L31634+++$+++It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.+++$+++L31635+++$+++Alex?
L31633+++$+++What time is it?+++$+++L31634+++$+++It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
L31632+++$+++Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.+++$+++L31633+++$+++What time is it?
L31630+++$+++I was having a nightmare.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31629+++$+++Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.+++$+++L31630+++$+++I was having a nightmare.
L31712+++$+++Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31711+++$+++Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.+++$+++L31712+++$+++Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
L31709+++$+++Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L31707+++$+++David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.+++$+++L31708+++$+++You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
L31706+++$+++Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.+++$+++L31707+++$+++David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
L31705+++$+++I really don't know.+++$+++L31706+++$+++Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
L31704+++$+++Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?+++$+++L31705+++$+++I really don't know.
L31703+++$+++No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.+++$+++L31704+++$+++Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
L31702+++$+++Did you see Jack?+++$+++L31703+++$+++No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
L31701+++$+++You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.+++$+++L31702+++$+++Did you see Jack?
L31700+++$+++Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.+++$+++L31701+++$+++You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
L31699+++$+++Yes.+++$+++L31700+++$+++Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
L31698+++$+++I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.+++$+++L31699+++$+++Yes.
L31697+++$+++Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?+++$+++L31698+++$+++I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
L31696+++$+++Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31695+++$+++You've never had bad dreams before?+++$+++L31696+++$+++Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.

L31626+++$+++How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.+++$+++L31627+++$+++In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
L31625+++$+++So they said.+++$+++L31626+++$+++How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
L31624+++$+++There were witnesses?+++$+++L31625+++$+++So they said.

L31582+++$+++You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of.

L32172+++$+++Because this must be stopped.+++$+++L32173+++$+++How shall I do it?
L32156+++$+++Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L31510+++$+++Oh shit. What is that?+++$+++L31511+++$+++A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.

L31495+++$+++Yeah.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31494+++$+++I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.+++$+++L31495+++$+++Yeah.
L31493+++$+++It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L31484+++$+++Could be a lot of things.+++$+++L31485+++$+++Yeah?
L31483+++$+++What was it?+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31482+++$+++I heard that.+++$+++L31483+++$+++What was it?
L31481+++$+++Did you hear that?+++$+++L31482+++$+++I heard that.
L31471+++$+++I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31470+++$+++Say, David...+++$+++L31471+++$+++I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
L31467+++$+++I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31466+++$+++Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.+++$+++L31467+++$+++I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
L31465+++$+++I have no idea.+++$+++L31466+++$+++Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
L31464+++$+++What do you think was wrong?+++$+++L31465+++$+++I have no idea.
L31463+++$+++Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31462+++$+++I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.+++$+++L31463+++$+++Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
L31461+++$+++That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.+++$+++L31462+++$+++I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
L31456+++$+++Come on, I'm freezing.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31455+++$+++Beware the moon?+++$+++L31456+++$+++Come on, I'm freezing.
L31454+++$+++I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.+++$+++L31455+++$+++Beware the moon?
L31453+++$+++What the hell was that all about?+++$+++L31454+++$+++I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
L31444+++$+++Apparently so.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31443+++$+++Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!+++$+++L31444+++$+++Apparently so.
L31441+++$+++What do you mean? I'm starving.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31440+++$+++Jack, we'd better go.+++$+++L31441+++$+++What do you mean? I'm starving.
L31431+++$+++You ask them.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31430+++$+++Go on, ask them.+++$+++L31431+++$+++You ask them.
L31427+++$+++Wrong.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31426+++$+++Right.+++$+++L31427+++$+++Wrong.
L31425+++$+++I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.+++$+++L31426+++$+++Right.
L31424+++$+++Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.+++$+++L31425+++$+++I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.

L31422+++$+++Ask them what the candles are for.+++$+++L31423+++$+++You ask them.
L31406+++$+++Maybe the owners are from Texas.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31405+++$+++It's a five-pointed star.+++$+++L31406+++$+++Maybe the owners are from Texas.
L31404+++$+++What about it?+++$+++L31405+++$+++It's a five-pointed star.
L31403+++$+++Look at that.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]
L31402+++$+++Listen, at least it's warm in here.+++$+++L31403+++$+++Look at that.
L31401+++$+++Nice looking group.+++$+++L31402+++$+++Listen, at least it's warm in here.
L31388+++$+++Nice to see you.+++$+++[N/A]+++$+++[N/A]

L31385+++$+++Okay.+++$+++L31386+++$+++Shall we?
L31384+++$+++I assume full responsibility.+++$+++L31385+++$+++Okay.
L31383+++$+++David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.+++$+++L31384+++$+++I assume full responsibility.
L31382+++$+++A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.+++$+++L31383+++$+++David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
L31381+++$+++That's not a spear. It's a pike.+++$+++L31382+++$+++A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
L31380+++$+++Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?+++$+++L31381+++$+++That's not a spear. It's a pike.

L31375+++$+++We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?+++$+++L31376+++$+++She says she 'likes me too much'.
L31374+++$+++It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.+++$+++L31375+++$+++We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
L31373+++$+++It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.+++$+++L31374+++$+++It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
L31372+++$+++I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.+++$+++L31373+++$+++It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
